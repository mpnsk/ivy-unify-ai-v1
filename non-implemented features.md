Ivy still has to implement automatic code conversion and Ã¯nstant mutli-framework support. It's not clear what that is supposed to mean. Probably the "transpiler between frameworks" part.

However using features from one framework, getting out the numbers in an ivy format and using them with another framework is implemented.

Ivy has "framework agnostic functions" for that. i.e. using ivy functions to act on framework datatypes.
